Today I built this blog and hosted it on Netlify.  
What a process. The front end was built using React and used a Gatsby boiler plate for the rest. This is the first app I've built using Gatsby as opposed to 'create-react-app'. I struggled for a minute passing my markdown object back and forth.  
But then struggled for two hours trying to deploy on Netlify. Little did I know that you needed to make sure the cassing for each component had to be the exact same from when you declared it to reference. That was fun.
